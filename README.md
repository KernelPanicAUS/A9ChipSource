# A9 Chip Source
A small iOS utility to identify the manufacturer of the A9 chip within the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus.

Made in reaction to the closed source tool advertised by Macrumors, which is signed with a leaked enterprise cert, collects UDIDs, and has Ads.

This open source version does none of that, it just prints out the information straight to the screen!
